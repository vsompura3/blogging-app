# BlogHub - A full stack blog application

## Overview

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) blog application with
front-end built using ReactJS and Vite, back-end built with NodeJS and Express,
and data stored in MongoDB using Mongoose. The application also uses TailwindCSS
for styling and React-Router for client-side routing. Postman can be used to
test the backend API.

## Setup Instructions

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
3. Install the dependencies:
4. Start the development server:
5. The frontend will be running at
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
2. Install the dependencies:
3. Set up the MongoDB connection:
